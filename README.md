# Bingus-Base
By: Hunter Williams and Owen Foster

## Purpose and Goals
The main purpose of the Bingus Database is to create a small console application that will use basic concepts of networking, such as TCP connections, sockets, and transmitting encoded data. The Bingus Database utilizes all of these to create a small server and a client application that connects, asks for user, input, and then transfers and image based on that input. 

## How to run Bingus-Base

### Download
Clone this Repo or download as a `.zip`. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your computer. We built this project with Python 3.10, but newer and older versions should still work.

### Check IP
The IP address is set by default to LocalHost (`127.0.0.1`). But you may change it to your liking. If you are running the client file for the in-class demonstration, change the IP in line 52 to the IP address on the board!

### RUN!
Start up the server by simply opening `server.py` and running it. The server will stay running for as many times you want to connect to it.
Then for the client, open `client.py` and run it. Make sure that the IP address in line 52 is correct, and you will be presented with further instructions from the server!
